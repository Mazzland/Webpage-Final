	<li>Julie Andrews reportedly turned down the role of Mrs. Potts.</li>
	<li>Belle is the only person in her village to wear blue.</li>
	<li>This film was nominated for best picture, but lost to Silence of the Lambs.</li>
	<li>Patrick Stewart, also professor X in X-Men, almost played Cogsworth but scheduling conflicts with Star Trek forced him to turn down the role.</li>
	<li>Rupert Evert auditioned for the voice of Gaston, but didn't land the part because producers thought he didn't sound arrogant enough. He took the critiques to heart when voicing Prince Charming in Shrek .</li>
	<li>Chip is the only member of the castle's inanimate talking staff to refer to Belle by name.</li>
	<li>Paige O'Hara was actually sobbing while recording Belle's mourning of the supposedly dead Beast. Her performance was so intense that the director asked her if she was ok, upon which O'Hara immediately dropped out of character and said "Acting!"</li>
	<li>An original version written of Gaston's death featured wolves killing him after he survived his fall from Beast's castle with a broken leg. Instead, this plot was used in The Lion King.</li>
	<li>The stained glass window that is seen at the very end of the movie was built after the film's release and now resides permanently at Disneyland.</li>
